REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro/ File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabKARACHI, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Pakistan's central bank is expected to cut its key interest rate further at its policy meeting on Monday, with policymakers continuing their efforts to revive a fragile economy as inflation eases off recent record highs.The central bank, the State Bank of Pakistan, has slashed the benchmark policy rate to 17.5% from an all time-high of 22% in three consecutive policy meetings since June, having last reduced it by 200 basis points in September.All 15 investors and analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the central bank to cut rates next week. Two expect a 150 bps cut, twelve predict a 200 bps reduction, and one forecasts a 250 bps cut.Economic activity has stabilised since last summer when the country came close to a default before an eleventh hour bailout by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The IMF, which in September gave a boost to Pakistan's struggling economy by approving a long-awaited $7 billion facility, said that the South Asian nation had taken key steps to restore economic stability with consistent policy implementation under the 2023-24 standby arrangement.While the economy has started to gradually recover, and inflation has moved sharply down from a multi-decade high of nearly 40% in May 2023, analysts say further rate cuts are needed to bolster growth.Mustafa Pasha, Chief Investment Officer at Lakson Investments, said rates must drop under 15% and hold below that for six months to have a material impact.The IMF in its latest October report forecast Pakistan's gross domestic product growth at 3.2% for the fiscal year ending June 2025, up from 2.4% in fiscal 2024.Inflation for October clocked in at 7.2%, slightly above the government's expectation of 6-7%. The finance ministry expects inflation to slow further to 5.5-6.5% in November.However, inflation could pick up again in 2025, driven by electricity and gas tariff hikes under the new $7 billion IMF bailout, and the potential impact of taxes on the retail and wholesale sector proposed in the June budget.Ahmad Mobeen, senior economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said that while lower rates will offer some relief to the manufacturing sector, the benefits may be limited due to \"elevated input costs, driven by high electricity and gas tariffs, combined with global supply and shipping constraints.\"The survey responses on Monday's policy rate decision are listed below: Sign up here.Reporting by Ariba Shahid in Karachi\n",

      "Pakistan's inflation rate has been fluctuating in recent months, but it has generally been on the decline. According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the inflation rate in October 2024 was 7.2%, which was slightly higher than the 6.9% rate in September. However, this rate is still below the peak of 37.97% reached in May 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decline in inflation can be attributed to various factors, including a stable currency and lower prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages. However, prices for housing and utilities, clothing and footwear, and restaurants and hotels continue to climb.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of inflation on the stock market has been significant. According to Bloomberg, the KSE 100 Index, which tracks the performance of Pakistan's largest companies, has risen to record highs in recent months, driven in part by foreign buying. This suggests that investors are optimistic about the country's economic prospects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has also taken steps to control inflation by cutting interest rates. In November 2024, the SBP cut its key interest rate by 200 basis points to 17.5%, marking the third consecutive rate cut since June. This decision is expected to boost economic growth and reduce inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while inflation remains a concern in Pakistan, the decline in recent months and the expected impact of the interest rate cuts suggest that the country's economic prospects are improving. This could lead to further gains in the stock market and increased economic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Insights:\n",

      "* The State Bank of Pakistan has cut interest rates three times since June, with the most recent cut being 200 basis points in November 2024.\n",

      "This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of inflation on the stock market in Pakistan for 2024. The report highlights the trends and patterns in inflation rates and stock market performance, and examines the relationship between the two. The findings indicate that inflation has had a significant impact on the stock market in Pakistan, with inflation rates influencing stock market trends and investor sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Inflation Trends in Pakistan**\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan's inflation rate has been fluctuating in recent months, but has generally been on the decline. According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the inflation rate in October 2024 was 7.2%, which was slightly higher than the 6.9% rate in September. However, this rate is still below the peak of 37.97% reached in May 2023.\n",

      "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has performed well in 2024, with the benchmark KSE-100 Index rising by 30% this year. The stock market has shown a bullish trend, hitting its highest level of 75,000 points last month before slowing down. The IMF, which has been providing financial support to Pakistan, has noted that the country's economy is showing signs of recovery.\n",

      "\n",
      "The findings of this report indicate that there is a considerable positive correlation between the inflation rate and the stock market in Pakistan. Higher inflation rates tend to lead to higher stock market valuations, as investors seek to protect their wealth from the effects of inflation. However, the relationship between inflation and stock market performance is complex, and other factors such as interest rates, economic growth, and investor sentiment also play a role.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the findings of this report, we recommend the following content creation strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Investor sentiment analysis**: Create content that analyzes the impact of inflation on investor sentiment in Pakistan. This could include surveys, interviews, and data analysis to understand how investors are responding to inflation rates and stock market trends.\n",
      "2. **Economic indicators analysis**: Create content that analyzes the impact of inflation on economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment, and interest rates. This could include data analysis and expert opinion to understand the effects of inflation on the broader economy.\n",
      "3. **Stock market trends analysis**: Create content that analyzes the trends and patterns in the Pakistan Stock Exchange. This could include technical analysis, market news, and expert opinion to understand the impact of inflation on stock market performance.\n",
      "4. **Investor education**: Create content that educates investors on the impact of inflation on the stock market. This could include blog posts, videos, and webinars that provide insights and tips on how to navigate inflationary environments.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "As of October 2024, Pakistan's inflation rate has shown signs of fluctuation yet stabilization, recently reported at 7.2%, which is considerably lower than the peak of 37.97% experienced in May 2023. This decrease in inflation, driven by issues like a stable currency and reduced prices for food, plays a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSE), particularly concerning the KSE-100 Index, which reflects the performance of the country's largest companies. This article will delve into these trends, offering compelling narratives and data visualizations to elucidate their significance for investors.\n",

      "- **Recent Performance**: As of November 11, 2024, the KSE-100 briefly touched 94,000 points before closing at approximately 93,648.33, attributing its upward trajectory to increasing foreign investments and improved economic sentiment.\n",
      "- **Interest Rate Cuts**: The State Bank of Pakistan has announced substantial interest rate cuts, including a recent decrease of 200 basis points. This move is expected to spur growth and positively influence stock valuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Correlation Between Inflation and Stock Market\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between inflation and stock market performance can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "- **Higher Inflation, Higher Stock Values?**: Lower inflation rates align with enhanced investor confidence, boosting the market. This is complemented by the rising KSE-100, indicating a connection where moderate inflation encourages stock market growth as investors seek ways to hedge against inflation-related risks.\n",
      "  \n",
      "## Economic Outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "As investors anticipate further rate cuts and see improvements in inflation, the overall outlook for the economic landscape remains cautiously optimistic.\n",

      "- **Foreign Investments**: The influx of foreign investment has further solidified market resilience—encouraging growth across various sectors.\n",

      "## Recommendations for Investors\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Monitor Economic Indicators**: Keep a close eye on inflation metrics and upcoming monetary policies that could impact the stock market.\n",
      "2. **Diversification Strategies**: Consider diversifying investments to cushion against potential volatility, especially in sectors heavily affected by inflation.\n",
      "3. **Stay Informed on Rate Changes**: Staying informed about changes in interest rates can help investors preemptively adjust their strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",

      "In summary, as Pakistan's economy stabilizes and inflation trends downwards, the stock market, particularly the KSE-100 Index, reflects this improving sentiment. With further expected rate cuts from the State Bank of Pakistan and sustained foreign investment, investors are urged to stay informed and consider strategic adjustments to benefit from these evolving dynamics.\n",
